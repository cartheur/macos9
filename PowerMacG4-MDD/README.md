### Removing the fan

I want to remove the internal silent fan from the PowerMac G4 MDD because the board does not provide sufficient current to start the fan rotating. This is okay for the single CPU tower since I can open and push-start it. However, with the dual-CPU tower, this was an issue since there is a short in the ground like around the door and the case causing the computer to shut-off when the door breaches this ground trace.
